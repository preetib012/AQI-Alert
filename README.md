# AQI-Alert

# Introduction :air_quality:

In this project, we are creating an Air Quality Monitoring and Alert System. It monitors air quality via a webserver and triggers alarms for harmful gases like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and NH3. Data is displayed on an LCD and webpage for easy monitoring.


## Components :gear:

- Arduino Board
- MQ135 Sensor
- 16x2 LCD
- Potentiometer
- Resistor
- LED
- Buzzer
- Breadboard

# Aim :dart:

The aim of this project is to develop an IoT-based air quality monitoring and alert system that can monitor and report air quality levels effectively.

## Scope :telescope:

The scope includes monitoring air quality over a webserver, triggering alarms for hazardous gas levels, and displaying real-time data on both LCD and web interface.

# Experimental Setup and Methods :test_tube:

Air quality monitoring systems integrate sensors, data analysis, and communication technologies to measure pollutants like CO, NO2, O3, SO2, and PM2.5. Data analysis computes Air Quality Index (AQI) and issues alerts via various channels.

### Components Used :electric_plug:

- Air quality sensor (MQ135)
- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD
- Buzzer
- LED
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- 1k Potentiometer
- 220-ohm Current Limiting Resistor
